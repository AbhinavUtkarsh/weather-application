# Weather Fetching Application

This is a very basic weather fetching application which provides weather from the [weatherstack API](weatherstack.com) and uses [mapbox](mapbox.com) to geo-code the provided address/location. 

This project was created to learn basics of Nodejs and express. The following concepts were learnt during the development of this application.

## Concepts Learnt & Implemented 

* Asynchronous Basics
* Call Stack, Callback Queue & Event Loop
* HTTP requests
* Callback functions
* Callback Chaining
* Object Property shorthand & object destructuring
* Serving HTML, JSON & Images
* Styling CSS
* jQuery
* Json endpoint
* ES6 Default parameters
* Deploying an application on Heroku
